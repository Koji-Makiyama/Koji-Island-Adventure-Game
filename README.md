# Koji Island Adventure Game

I created this CLI adventure game in Python for my Nanodegree at Udacity.

FOR WINDOWS:\
(Install Python, e.g. Python 3.10.4.)\
https://www.python.org/downloads/ \
Extract the cloned zip file.\
Open the Command Prompt.\
Use 'cd' (change directory) to navigate to the extracted folder.\
Enter 'python koji_island_agv13.py'.\
And the program should begin prompting you with messages!
